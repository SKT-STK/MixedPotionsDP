this datapack allows you to mix up to 3 different potions into one using a cauldron!  
you can use it by right-clicking the top of the cauldron with a potion  
right-clicking the sides of the cauldron will display vanilla behavior  
you can take the mixed potion out of the cauldron with a glass bottle (mixtures of 2 or 3 diff potions are allowed as taking out a single potion out would break the potion in context of a brewing stand)  
the only limitation of this datapack is that you cant 0-tick a cauldron (syncing entities to blocks is already hard enough)  

!!! IMPORTANT !!!  
THIS DATAPACK HAS A CORRESPONDING RESOURCEPACK (MixedPotionsRP)
